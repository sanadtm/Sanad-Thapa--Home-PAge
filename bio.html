            <b>Hi!! My name is Sanad Thapa </b> and I am originally from Nepal moved to the US
            in 2014 with my family. Something interesting about being has to be that I was in
            the junior national team for Table Tennis in Nepal back in 2011 and 2012 and I
            have been investing a lot in stocks and crypto which has been a roller coaster of
            a ride. In my free time, I like t6o work out, play video games, sit by the
            campfire and hang out with friends and family and go to the table tennis clubs to
            work out.
